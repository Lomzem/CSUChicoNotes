# Domains of Potential Problems
- User domain
- Workstation domain
- LAN domain
- LAN-to-WAN domain
- WAN domain
- Remote Access domain
- Systems/Applications domain

# Why Aren't Systems Secure?
- Security is fundamentally hard
- Security is an afterthought
- Security is an impediment to progress
- False solutions
- Belief that ppl are the problem, not computers (need to teach ethics)
- Technology is oversold
- Security is expensive (kind of like insurance)
- Technology vs. Solution

# Common Threats in the User Domain
- Lack of user awareness
- User apathy toward policies
- User violating security policy
- User inserting USB w/personal files
- User downloading photos/music/videos
- User destructing systems, applications, data
- Disgruntled employee attacking organization or committing sabotage
- Employee blackmail or extortion

# Common Threats in the Workstation Domain
- Unauthorized workstation access
- Unauthorized access to systems, applications, and data
- Desktop/laptop OS vulnerabilities
- Desktop/laptop application software vulnerabilities/patches
- Viruses, malicious code, malware
- User inserting USB w/persona files
- User downloading photos, music, videos

# Common Threats in the LAN Domain
- Unauthorized physical access to LAN (putting Ethernet cable in port)
- Unauthorized access to systems, applications, data
- LAN server OS vulnerabilities
- LAN server application software vulnerabilities/software patch updates
- Rogue users on WLANs (wireless LANs), ppl on wifi that shouldn't be
- Confidentiality of data on WLANs (unencrypted wireless network, could sniff traffic)
- LAN server config guidelines/standards

# Common Threats in the LAN-to-WAN Domain
- Internal network connects to external network (Internet)
- Unauthorized probing and port scanning
- Unauthorized access
- Internet Protocol (IP) router, firewall, network appliance OS vulnerabilities
- Local users downloading unknown file types from unknown sources

# Common Threats in the WAN Domain
- Open, public, accessible data
- Most traffic being sent as clear text
- Vulnerable to eavesdropping
- Vulnerable to malicious attacks
- Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
    - Solution is more bandwidth or direct protection against DDoS
- Vulnerable to corruption of info/data
- Insecure Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) application
- Hackers/attackers emailing Trojans, worms, malicious software freely and constantly

# Common Threats in the Remote Access Domain
- Brute force user ID/password attacks
- Multiple logon retires and access control attacks
- Unauthorized remote access to IT systems, applications, data
- Confidential data compromised remotely
- Data leakage in violation of data classification standards

# Common Threats in the Systems/Applications Domain
- Unauthorized access to data centers, computer room, wiring closets (physical access)
- Difficult-to-manage servers that require high availability
- Server OS software vulnerability management
- Security required by cloud computing virtual environments
- Corrupt/lost data

# Security Technologies Used
1) Anti-virus software
2) Firewall
3) Anti-spyware software
4) Virtual private network (VPN)
5) Vulnerability/Patch Management
    - Look at all servers, their versions, check what needs to be patched, what vulnerabilities are present

Also:
- Application firewalls
- Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
    - Software that auto blocks suspicious behavior on network
- Log management software
- Forensic tools
- Smart cards/other one-time tokens (2-Factor auth)
- Biometrics

# Extra Thoughts
- The defender has to find and eliminate all exploitable vulnerabilities; attacker only needs to find one
- "A good attack is one that engineers never thought of" - Bruce Schneier
- "The three golden rules to ensure computer security are: do not own a computer; do not power it on; and do not use it"
