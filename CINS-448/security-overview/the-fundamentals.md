# The Fundamentals
- Confidentiality (eavesdropping and data theft)
- Integrity (data corruption and tampering)
- Availability & Reliability (service denial and data loss)

# Confidentiality

## Personal Data and Information
- Aka PII (Personal Identifiable Information)
- Credit card acc num, bank acc num
- Social security num, address info

## Intellectual Property
- Copyrights, patents, secret formulas
- Source code, customer databases, technical specifications

## National Security
- Military intelligence
- Homeland security/govt related info

## How is Confidentiality Compromised
- Hackers
- Masqueraders (pretending to be real customers)
- Unauthorized user activity
- Unprotected downloaded files
- Data can be viewed at any node of the network (use a "sniffer")
- Trojan horses
- Social engineering

# Integrity
Maintain valid, uncorrupted, and accurate info

## Examples
- Usernames/Passwords
- Patents/Copyrights
- Source code
- Diplomatic info
- Financial data

## How to Maintain Integrity
- Protect database w/firewall
- Grant access on a need-to-know basis (start w/least privilege necessary to access data)
- Separation of duties: no single employee has control of a transaction from beginning to end
- Rotation of duties: change job assignments periodically

# Availability

## Can be Compromised By:

### Denial-of-service (DDoS)
- intruder ties up the system
- Botnet system comprised of several computers (zombie cpus) sends traffic to site to attack

### Result of Natural Disaster
- Fires, floods, etc.

### Human Actions
- Bombs, strikes
