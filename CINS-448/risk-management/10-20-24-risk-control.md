# Risk Control
A risk-reducing measure that acts to:
- Detect loss
- Prevent loss
- Minimize loss

# Risk Response Planning
- Avoid
- Transfer
- Mitigate
- Accept

# Establishing Risk Acceptance Criteria
- Need to establish maximum acceptable financial risk
    - Example: "do not accept more than a 1 in 100 chance of losing $1,000,000 in a given year"

# Uncertainty
Degree (0%-100%) of less than complete confidence in the value of any element of the risk assessment

# Cost / Benefit Analysis
Once safeguard selected, how much money expected to save vs how much does it cost to implement (Total Cost of Ownership (TCO))

Also known as Return on Investment (ROI)

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) < Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) = + Return on Investment (ROI)

Example:
- If we expect to lose 50% of assets (exposure factor) which are worth $1 mill
- Annualized rate of occurrence is 1/10 (once in 10 years)
- ALE = ($1M * 50% = $500K) * 1/10 = $50K
- Therefore, could justify spending up to $50K to prevent occurrence or reduce impact
