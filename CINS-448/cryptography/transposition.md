# Transposition
- Rearranges characters in plaintext to form ciphertext
- Letters are not changed, just different order
- Example: [[rail-fence-cipher#Rail fence cipher|Rail Fence Cipher]]

# How to Detect a Transposition Cipher
1. Examine frequency of letters found in ciphertext
2. Compare frequency with a table of character frequencies in English language
3. If the frequencies are equal, can guess that characters have been rearranged, not replaced (substitution)
- Most common: e, t, a, i, o
- Least common: x, z, j, q, k

# Attacking a Transposition Cipher

## Anagramming
- Rearrange letters of ciphertext
- Use tables of letter combination frequencies to identify common letter pairings

Common letter pairs:
th, er, on, an, re, he, in, ed, nd, ha, at, en, es, of, or, nt, ea, ti, to, it, st, io, le, is, ou, ar, as, de, rt, ve
