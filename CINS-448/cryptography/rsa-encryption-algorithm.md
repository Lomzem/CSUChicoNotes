# RSA Encryption Algorithm
- Developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, Leonard Adleman
- Based on fact that easily and quickly could multiply two large prime numbers together; very long time to factor number into its two prime factors
- Products large enough (>500 digits) could result in factor of millions/billions difference in time required
