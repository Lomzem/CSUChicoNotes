# Cryptography
- "secret writing" in Greek
- **plaintext**: useful information before scrambled
- **ciphertext**: useful info after scrambled

# Cryptosystem
- set of plaintexts
- set of keys
- set of ciphertexts
- enciphering functions

Take **plaintext**, turn it into **ciphertexts** using a **key** to run it through an **enciphering function**

# How attack is accomplished
- Math/stats
- Statistical methods
- Make assumptions about statistics of the plaintext language
- Assumptions are also called "the model"
- Examine the ciphertext to correlate its properties with the assumptions

# Classical cryptosystem (Single-key, Symmetric)
- Use one key to both encrypt and decrypt
- Example: Caesar's cipher

# Two types of classical ciphers
1. [[transposition#Transposition|Transposition]]
2. [[substitution#Substitution Cipher|Substitution]]
