Based on the film “The Mindful Way,” how do the monks themselves describe the experience of meditation and their way of life? What struck you most about their life or observations? 

# Notes
- Daily dawn walk to receive food offered by villagers
- Pure & simple life
- Cannot possess money or grow own food
- Total dependence on laity
- 13yr - 70yr
- Majority only stay for year or two
- After dawn walk, eat only meal of the day; vegetables + rice
- Wake up at 3am
- Start day with chanting, meditation, chores/duties
- After breakfast, only consume liquids
- After breakfast, bow to Buddha, Dharma, Sangha
- "Learn to be in harmony with the way things are in nature, could live happily and peacefully"
- "Monk is able to contemplate the nature of things"
- "Understands that all forms of life degenerate and eventually die; nothing that exists is permanent. When one understands this, he becomes calm and serene"
- "Even the most mundane activity could be meditation if carried out mindfully"
- Much of day is making/maintaining few possessions, meditation could become constant practice
- "Monks are trained to be content w/little, to eat only what they need, to sleep only when necessary, to be satisfied w/what they have. This is foundation for Buddhist meditation"
- "Dont practice meditation for selfish reasons. Practice to know ourselves so we could understand and teach others how to live peacefully and wisely"
- Monks believe their lives are NOT lazy/easy
- "A monk's work is hard; he works to free his heart so that he could feel loving kindness, which embraces everything. Belives all life has characteristics of the breath that rises and falls. Everything born expires, so suffering diminishes knowing nothing belongs to him"
- "More useful to self and others. Learn teaching to pass it on to others"
- Day's activities regulate by a bell; twice a month it calls them to confession and they recite to each other categories of offense
- "Monk learns to challenge his moods. Become aware of everything that passes thru our minds. Watch feelings but dont cling to them and follow them. Watch them come and go"
- After confession, ritual recitation of 227 rules
- Monastery exerts pull on laity, laity provide all money for buildings
- "If there's any illness in my mind, I come here for a cure. Whenever I feel suffering I come here. He teaches me to come to terms w/things and find a purpose in life. Explains to me nature of things, how suffering arises and how to end it"
- "If our body really belonged to us, it would obey our commands. Don't own house, rent it. If we believe it belongs to us, when we die and have to leave it, we suffer. In reality, there is no such thing as a self"
- "There isn't everybody. Theres only Earth, fire, water, air"
- Some lay community sit up all night meditating w/monks
- "To understand "No-self", must meditate. If only intellectualize it, head will explode"
- "Once you understand "No-self", burden of life is gone. Daily life w/family. work, will be much easier. Will be at peace w/world"
- "When we see beyond self, no longer cling to happiness, when we stop clinging, we can begin to be happy"
- "Shouldn't be concerned w/attaining nirvana; that in itself will prevent u from attaining it"
- "Main aim is to let go. You should let go without desire. If there's still desire in the pursuit to do that, that's not nirvana"
- "Be mindful and let things take their natural course, then mind will become still. Will see many wonderful things come/go, but you will be still. Problems will arise but youll see thru them immediately. This is the happiness of the Buddha"
