## New Understandings of Life and Death

#definition/rels
### Karma
"action": cosmic law of cause and effect. If you perform your dharma, you will attain a higher rebirth

#definition/rels
### Samsara
cycle of rebirth/reincarnation

#definition/rels
### Dharma
not just social duties connected to sacrificial offerings but the whole cosmic law/cosmic order of the universe

# Goal of Vedantic Hinduism
#definition/rels
- Gain moksha: liberation from cycle of samsara by realizing true nature of reality

#definition/rels
- Live life of asceticism and meditation to gain knowledge of your true self (Atman)

#definition/rels
- This pathway to moksha is called jnana yoga
- Yoga: discipline/path, synonyms with asceticism (Greek)
- Jnana: knowledge
- Give up your desires

# Path to Moksha in Jnana Yoga
- Intense study
#definition/rels
- Strict moral code, ahimsa (not harming other beings) and giving  up desires (fasting/celibacy)
#definition/rels
- Renounce the world (a sannyasin is one who does this)
- Meditative practices to attain knowledge of the Atman and its oneness with Brahman
- Eliminate all karma residue making up the jiva (sheath) and separating Atman and Brahman

# Atman
- True self
- Beyond externals of body, senses, personality
- Stays the same from life to life
- Can be known through yoga (discipline)
- Kind of like "soul" but different

The Katha Upanishad says the Atman is "beyond sound and form, without taste and touch and perfume. It is eternal, unchangeable, and without beginning or end; indeed, above reasoning. When consciousness of the Atman manifests itself, man becomes free from the jaws of death"

# Nature of Ultimate Reality
#definition/rels
- Universe seems to be full of countless beings but is a misperception based on maya (illusion)
- Ultimately all of reality is made up of Brahman, the spiritual oneness underlying all things; the ultimate reality
- On a fundamental level, your true self (Atman) is identical with Brahman
- "This in truth is that"

# Hindu Concept of the Person: Chariot Metaphor
We are made of 5 components:
1. Body (chariot)
2. Senses (horses)
3. Reason/Intellect (buddhi) (charioteer)
4. Mind/consciousness (reins)
5. Atman, true self, rest changes from life to life (rider)

#definition/rels
Purusha: synonym for Brahman

#definition/rels
preya: path of pleasure

#definition/rels
shreya: path that is beneficial
