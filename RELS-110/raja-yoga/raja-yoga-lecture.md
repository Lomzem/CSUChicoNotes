# Raja Yoga: 8 Steps for ekarata

Must follow them **in their order**, or it won't work (meditation practices)

1) 5 restraints, the basic ethical principles
- Ahimsa (no-harm)
- No lying (satya)
- No stealing (asteya)
- No being greedy/having few possessions (aparigraha)
- No sex (brahmacharya)

2) 5 disciplines
- Purity/cleanliness
- Serenity/contentment
- Austerity/Discipline
- Study
- Worship/Devotion

3) Asanas: disciplined postures to help you be still for long periods, focus on your breathing to forget your body

4) Breath control (Pranayama)
- one makes the 3 component actions of breathing (inhalation, retention, exhalation) to be of equal duration
- one makes duration of each of the 3 acts longer and longer

5) Sense withdrawal
- Focus internally rather than externally

6) Concentration/Focused attention (dharana): The mind learns to focus on a single object of thought
- "Mental stability involves the mind becoming focused on such places as the sphere of the navel, the lotus of the heart, the light in the brain, the tip of the nose, the tip of the tongue, and similar parts of the body; or on any other external object"

7) Meditation (Dhyana)
- Concentration has become focused enough that there is no longer a division between the perceiver and what they perceive

8) Samadhi (absorbed concentration)
- Total overcoming of external world; total fusion of perception with what is perceived; overcoming reasoning or reflection, just the tranquility of the settled mind. The sattvic (pure) mind is only aware of its own joy. Focus on inner powers of perception and within mind itself. Known as "blissful" Samadhi filled with joyful peace. Mental flux overcome and liberation is achieved
