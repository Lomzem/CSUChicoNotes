# Yoga
The religious life rests firmly upon the moral life. It is not possible even to begin the process of seeking liberation unless one is committed to treating others properly.

Not compatible with sexual activity or accumulation/use of property

Cannot begin meditation unless one has first learned self-discipline

Yoga is a [[vocab-raja-yoga#theistic|theistic]] system

The [[vocab-raja-yoga#yoga|Yoga]] technique has **eight stages**:

# 1. _Yama_
"social ethics"
Consists of five "restraints":
1) non-injury, [[vocab-raja-yoga#ahimsa|ahimsa]]
2) truthfulness
3) not stealing
4) sexual abstinence
5) non-possession

# 2. Niyama
"personal ethics"
Consists of five "disciplines":
1) purity
2) serenity
3) austerity
4) study
5) worshop of god/[[vocab-raja-yoga#Iavara|Iavara]]

# 3. Asana
"posture"
onepointedness on the physical plane; reduces physical effort and allows long periods of concentration without physical discomfort (for meditation)

# 4. Pranayama
"breathing"
the control of **breathing**: recognizes the influence of psychosomatic functions on breathing and vice versa; induces calm and helps concentration

# 5. Pratyahara
withdrawal of senses from the objects of sensation. The object is now internalized; i.e.known without the presence of the external object. Removes one of the greatest sources of distraction--the senses

# 6. Dharana
"concentration"
total comprehension of the object of meditation

# 7. Dhyana
"meditation"
prolonged concentration on the object thus comprehended

# 8. Samadhi
"[[vocab-raja-yoga#enstasis|enstasis]]"
total identification of the mental process with the object; total coincidence between the knowledge of the object and the object of knowledge

Two types:
1) With the object of meditation: one realizes the difference between purified consciousness and the [[vocab-raja-yoga#purusha|Soul/purusha]]. Attained at fruit of human effort. Liberation is **not** reached

2) Without an object of meditation: mental flux caused by [[vocab-raja-yoga#buddhi|buddhi]] is destroyed. Total rupture of planes--transcendence of ordinary consciousness. **Not** fruit of action: just happens, unprovoked. Experience constitutes liberation
