# Ancient Hinduism and the Vedas

#definition/rels
# What is Hinduism?
- From Sindu/"Indus River"
- Hindus call their own religion Sanatana Dharma (Eternal cosmic order/eternal faith)
- Hinduism term for religion came from 1816 British for Indians who followed the Vedas
- Over 3500 years old
- Does not have a founder
- Found throughout India

# Complexity of Hinduism
- Rig Veda: "Truth is one; people call it by many names"
- Different paths to the same goal
- Acknowledges regional and historical complexity and embraces diversity

# Variation in Hinduism Over Time

## Ancient (Vedic) Hinduism
- 1500-500 BCE
- Vedas: the most ancient sacred texts
- For >1000 years, only transmitted orally

## Vedantic (Upanishadic) Hinduism
- 500 BCE onward
- Vedanta means "the end of the Vedas"
- Upanishads as the last of the ancient sacred texts
- Vedanta developed concepts of [[studying-religion-from-academic-perspective#Asian Beliefs of Time|reincarnation and cycle of Samsara

## Devotional (Bhakti) Hinduism
- 500 CE onward
- Epic literature (Stories of the Gods like the Puranas, the [[ramayana|Ramayana]], and the Mahabharata)

# Indus Valley Civilization (Punjab region)
- 3300 BCE - 1900 BCE
- Located in present day Pakistan
- Planned cities
- Written language
- Possibly worshipped a mother goddess, a proto-Shiva figure
- Little burial of dead (possibly cremation)

## Theories of Indus Valley Collapse
- Most popular: ecological reasons (drought)
- Older: invasion of Indo-Aryan

# Dravidian Culture
- Perhaps ancient indigenous Indians or perhaps migrants from the collapsing Indus Valley civilization or from Iran around 8000 BCE
- Religion was NON-VEDIC. See [[ancient-hinduism-and-the-vedas#Ancient (Vedic) Hinduism|Vedic]]
- Centered around worship of natural forces which were often personified as female (earth and river goddesses)
#definition/rels
- Might have had a proto Shikti-Shiva (female-male gods worshipped together)
- Female priests who were ritually possessed to predict the future and heal illness

# Indo-Aryan (Indo-European)
#definition/rels
- Aryan: Persian word for noble
- Nomadic tribes in Central Asia who spread out in all directions (comes from linguistic similarities)
- Many Indians say culture is all indigenous
- But: DNA evidence of migration starting around 1500 BCE
- Could be from Iran, Central Eurasian warriors, Kurgans

## Definite Linguistic and Religious Influence from Indo-Europeans

### Vedic Religion:
- Father God (Dyaus), associated with sky, very similar to Zeus
- Both Vedic religion and ancient Greco-Roman religion very this-wordly oriented; both start off with very little attention to an afterlife
- Goal: success in this life (fertile fields, children, good health, wealth)
- Like other ancient religions, most Gods and Goddesses are seen as embodiment of natural forces
- Most of religion: sacrificial offerings to ask the gods for help (also common in other ancient religions like Judaism and Greco-Roman)
