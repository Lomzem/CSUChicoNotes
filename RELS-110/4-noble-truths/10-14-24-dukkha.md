# Dukkha
"suffering"

Life is dukkha

Types of suffering
- Physical
- Mental
- Impermanence: even of the "self", nothing lasts forever

# Impermanence and Anatman
"no self" / "no Atman"
Denies existence of Atman, something that passes on from life to life

Think: Atman continues on throughout each reincarnation

Anatman believes: Nothing that is unchanging, eternal, constant
