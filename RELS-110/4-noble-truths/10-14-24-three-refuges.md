Members of the Buddhist tradition take refuge in:

1) Buddha
- The enlightened teacher (who in Therevada Buddhism has entered nirvana)

2) Dharma
- Teachings of the Buddha (compare to Hindu Dharma, which is cosmic laws that structure universe)

3) Sangha
- Ancient times meant Buddhist monks/nuns
- Modern means whole Buddhist community
