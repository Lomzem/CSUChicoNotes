# Nirguna
Brahman as a universal spirit that makes up everything

Without form, qualities, individual characteristics

# Saguna
Gods and Goddesses are saguna (have form, deliberately to be able to interact with devotees)

# Advaita Vedanta
- Non-dualistic
- Everything is Brahman

# Dvaita Vedanta
- Dualistic
- God and soul are separate realities
- Also a reality halfway between the two

All encompassing divine being looking for someone to love creates a world of semi-separate beings so deity can love us and we an love them; eventually they'll all work their way back to oneness with me and we can start over
