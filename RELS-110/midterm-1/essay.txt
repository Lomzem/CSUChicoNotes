Hinduism is a diverse religion with many branching traditions. For example, Bhakti Hinduism prioritizes devotion and worship to a God. In contrast, Jnana Yoga Hinduism emphasises self-discipline and control. However, there are still striking similarities between the different traditions. In Hinduism, the cycle of samsara describes the reincarnation cycle of souls from life to life. Ultimately, although these traditions differ in how they approach their goals, they do share a similar end goal in finally escaping from this cycle.
