Hinduism is a diverse religion with many branching traditions. For example, Bhakti Hinduism prioritizes devotion and worship to a personal deity, while Jnana Yoga Hinduism emphasises self-discipline and control. However, there are still striking similarities between the different traditions. In Hinduism, the cycle of samsara describes the reincarnation cycle of souls from life to life. Ultimately, although these traditions differ in how they approach their goals, they do share a similar end goal in finally escaping from this cycle.

In Jnana Yoga, one fundamental goal is to escape the rebirth cycle and unite oneself with Brahman. This state of liberation is known as "moksha" in Hinduism. The Katha Upanishad, an ancient spiritual text of Jnana Yoga explains, "What lies beyond life shines not to those who are childish, or careless, or deluded by wealth. 'This is the only world: there is no other', they say: and thus they go from death to death" (58). The phrase "death to death" describes the reincarnation cycle of samsara in Hinduism. The scripture explains that caring only about wealth and possessions in this world will result in remaining trapped in this endless cycle of rebirth. Moreover, the Upanishad introduces the concept of the Atman in Jnana Yoga, describing it as "the Spirit of vision, is never born and never dies. Before him there was nothing, and he is ONE for evermore. Never-born and eternal, beyond times gone or to come, he does not die when the body dies" (Upanishad 59)". Essentially, this Atman is a spiritual, soul-like concept that exists in everyone. The characteristic of "never-born and eternal" describes how the Atman persists throughout people's reincarnations from death to death. To observe and understand this Atman present in everything, the Upanishad teaches that

Additionally, the Upanishads outline a path to achieve moksha and unite with Brahman. However, the passage does conclude that having pure intentions and revoking a life of pleasure can open oneself to observing Brahman. 

To achieve the ultimate goal of unifying with Brahman, practitioners of Jnana Yoga must pursue a path of knowledge. 

Bhakti Hinduism differs from Jnana Yoga with its dualistic view of the divine. 

Both branches of Hinduism share the goal of achieving moksha: escaping from the reincarnation cycle of samsara.
