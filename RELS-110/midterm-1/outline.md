# Sources
- Katha Upanishad from 9/6
- Kirkland reading from 9/13
- Puja film from 9/20

# General
Upanishads onwards, everyone's goal was moksha

# Hindu bhakti tradition (Must)
- Devotional tradition
- Worship specific God/dess or family of God/desses (Shiva, Parvati, Ganesha, or Krishna and Radha) who is seen as personal face of Brahman
- Through devotion, puja (offerings), and pilgrimage, seek union w/God/dess
- Basic idea: all encompassing divine being, looking for someone to love, creates a world of semi-separate beings so the deity can love us and we can love them; billion-year love story. Eventually they'll all work their way back to oneness with me and we can start over
- Worship thru:
    - Mantra: chanting name of god
    - Puja: various offerings of things
    - Pilgrimage: to holy sites associated w/God
- Ultimate goal/how to understand Moksha: seeking union w/God/dess you've worshiped whole life
- Dvaita Vedanta (dualistic), teaches that God and the soul are separate realities, as well as one that's sort of halfway between those two
- Darshan: seeing/being seen by deity
    - come into their presence
    - consecration of images
- Saguna (with form)

# Hindu jnana yoga
- knowledge yoga
- Katha Upanishad
- Goal is moksha, liberation from cycle of samsara
- Sept 6 module
- Meditating on Brahman, impersonal
- Non-Dualistic: no separation between God and you/God and universe
- Brahman as universal spirit that makes up everything is nirguna: without form/without qualities/without individual characteristics. VERY DIFFERENT from God/dess of bhakti, who are saguna (have form, deliberately so they can interact with devotees)
- Focus on self-discipline and meditation to interact w/Brahman
- Study w/Guru/teacher
- Strict moral code, including ahimsa (no harm) and giving up desires (practicing fasting/celibacy)
- Renounce the world (sannyasin is one who does this)
- Meditative practices to attain knowledge of Atman and its oneness w/Brahman
- Eliminate all karmic residue making up the jiva (sheath) separating Atman and Brahman
- Takes whole lifetime of asceticism, very difficult, why some people chose bhakti
- Self control, taking control of chariot/horses
- Body/senses are unruly horses that want to lead us to path of pleasure or praya when we need to choose path of Shreya or what's good for us
- TALK ABOUT KATA UPANISHAD, what is says about Atman (beyond sound/form wo taste/touch, eternal, unchangeable, wo beginning/end), consciousness of Atman will free from jaws of death

# Hindu raja yoga
- Patanjali
- Non-Dualistic: no separation between God and you/God and universe
- Brahman as universal spirit that makes up everything is nirguna: without form/without qualities/without individual characteristics. VERY DIFFERENT from God/dess of bhakti, who are saguna (have form, deliberately so they can interact with devotees)
- Focus on self-discipline and meditation to interact w/Brahman
Goal: moksha: liberation from cycle of samsara
- Path to goal: 8 stages of raja yoga
- Main spiritual practices: 8 stages, but especially last 3 which are types of meditation
Goal: ekagrata (one-pointedness)
- Stage 1 + 2: 5 restraints and 5 disciplines
- 5 restraints: Ahimsa(no-harm) No lying(satya); no stealing(asteya); No being greedy/having few possessions(aparigraha); no sex(brahmacharya)
- 5 disciplines: Purity/cleanliness; serenity/contentment; austerity/discipline; study; worship/devotion
- 3. Asanas: disciplined postures to help you be still for long periods, focus on your breathing to forget your body
- 4. Breath control (Pranayama): inhalation, retention, exhalation are equal duration, making duration longer and longer
- 5. Sense-withdrawal: focus internally rather than externaly
- 6. Concentration/focused attention (dharana) mind learns to focus on single object of thought
- 7. Meditation (Dhyana) concentration focused enough is no longe r adivision between perceiver and what they perceive
- 8. Samadhi (absorbed concentration): total overcoming of external world; total fusion of perception w/what is perceived; overcoming reasoning/reflection, just tranquility of settled mind. Sattvic (pure) mind is only aware of its own joy. Focus on inner powers of perception and within the mind itself. Blissful Samadhi filled w/joyful peace. Mental flux overcome and liberation is achieved
