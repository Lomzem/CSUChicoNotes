# Hindu jnana yoga

"Death. There is the path of joy, and there is the path of pleasure. Both attract the soul. Who follows pleasure reaches not the End" (Katha Upanishad 57)

"There is a path of wisdom and the path of ignorance. They are far apart and lead to different ends. You are, Nachiketas, a follower of the path of wisdom: many pleasures tempt you not" (Upanishad 58).

"What lies beyond life shines not to those who are childish,  or careless, or deluded by wealth. 'This is the only world: there is no other', they say: and thus they go from death to death" (Upanishad 58).

"When a man has heard and has understood and, finding the essence, reaches the Inmost, then he finds joy in the Source of joy. Nachiketas is a house open for thy Atman, thy God" (Upanishad 59).

"Atman, the Spirit of vision, is never born and never dies. Before him there was nothing, and he is ONE for evermore. Never-born and eternal, beyond times gone or to come, he does not die when the body dies" (Upanishad 59).

"Concealed in the heart of all beings is the Atman, the SPirit, the Self; smaller than the smallest atom, greater than the vast spaces. The man who surrenders his human will leaves sorrows behind, and holds the glory of the Atman by the grace of the Creator" (Upanishad 59).

"The Atman is beyond sound and form, without touch and taste and perfume. It is eternal, unchangeable, and without beginning or end: indeed above reasoning. When consciousness of the Atman manifests itself, man becomes free from the jaws of death" (Upanishad 61).

"The foolish run after outward pleasures and fall into the snares of vast-embracing death. But the wise have found immortality, and do not seek the Eternal in things that pass away" (Upanishad 62).

"The soul may go to the womb of a mother and thus obtain a new body. It even may go into trees or plants, according to its previous wisdom and work" (Upanishad 64).

"There is one Ruler, the Spirit that is in all things, who transforms his own form into many. Only the wise who see him in their souls attain the joy eternal" (Upanishad 64).

!!!
"If one sees him in this life before the body passes away, one is free from bondage; but if not, one is born and dies again in new worlds and new creations" (Upanishad 65).

!!!
"His form is not in the field of vision: no one sees him with mortal eyes. He is seen by a pure heart and by a mind and thoughts that are pure. Those who know him attain life immortal" (Upanishad 65).

"Words and thoughts cannot reach him and he cannot be seen by the eye" (Upanishad 66).

"When all desires that cling to the heart are surrendered, then a mortal becomes immortal, and even in this world he is one with Brahman" (Upanishad 66).

# Bhakti

"A puja is a vehicle through which we pray to God" (Puja 0:19)

"After I offer the flowers and the fruit ... We do the aarti to the feet of the god " (Puja 2:0)

"Hinduism ... [featuers] rituals and ceremonies that honor a host of powerful deities. For Hindus, these deities represent aspects of a single, infinite, divine spirit, known to most as Brahman" (Puja 2:50)

"Through puja, worshipers express their divine religious devotion by honoring aspects of the divine spirit most relevant to their lives"  (Puja 3:0)

"Anu Subramanian: I like all the gods and goddesses because, you know, they are basically all one. But, I'm more partial to Krishna. I can really relate to him. He's mischievous and he's kind of, you know, naughty, but at the same time he's very kind and compassionate" (Puja 3:41)

"Within the Hindu pantheon, three deities are most commonly worshiped. Vishnu, the Preserver and Protector of World Order, appears in many incarnations such as Krishna, and is also signified by stylized versions of his footprint. Shiva, the Creator and Destroyer, is often portrayed as a male figure with his consort, Parvati, or represented by the abstract linga and yoni. The Goddess, Devi, exists in many female manifestations, including Lakshmi, Durga, and Saraswati" (Puja 5:0)

"During puja, the worshiper seeks darshan, a direct visual connection with the deity achieved through sacred objects in the form of natural elements, framed images, or sculptures" (Puja 5:20)

"Regardless of its form, the object becomes a receptacle for divine energy, and a focal point for the worshiper to see and be seen by the deity" (Puja 5:41).

!!! ATMAN
"Bell-ringing awakens the spirit, clears the mind, and helps focus the worshiper on the present moment. Incense symbolizes the scent and spirit of life, which permeates one's being and lingers after death" (Puja 7:50).

!!! ATMAN
"Fire suggests the presence of the divine is contained within oneself" (Puja 8:0).

"During the ritual, worshipers offer flowers or food to the deity. These offerings are essential to the ceremony, reinforcing the concept of reciprocity that in giving, one receives" (Puja 8:19).

"In honoring the deity, it unites the body with the spirit, the temporal with the sacred, the individual with the infinite" (Puja 10:0)

"When the pujas are performed, it gives you peace of mind and an understanding of the complex nature of yourself and your fellow family members, to deal with difficult situations daily" (Puja 10:23)
