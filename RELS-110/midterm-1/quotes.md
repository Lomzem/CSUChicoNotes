"Death. There is the path of joy, and there is the path of pleasure. Both attract the soul. Who follows pleasure reaches not the End" (Katha Upanishad 57)

"There is a path of wisdom and the path of ignorance. They are far apart and lead to different ends. You are, Nachiketas, a follower of the path of wisdom: many pleasures tempt you not" (Upanishad 58).

"What lies beyond life shines not to those who are childish,  or careless, or deluded by wealth. 'This is the only world: there is no other', they say: and thus they go from death to death" (Upanishad 58).

"When a man has heard and has understood and, finding the essence, reaches the Inmost, then he finds joy in teh Source of joy. Nachiketas is a house open for thy Atman, thy God" (Upanishad 59).

"Atman, the Spirit of visoin, is never born and never dies. Before himt here was nothing, and he is ONE for evermore. Never-born and eternal, beyond times gone or to come, he does not die when the body dies" (Upanishad 59).

"Concealed in the heart of all beings is the Atman, the SPirit, the Self; smaller than the smallest atom, greater than the vast spaces. The man who surrenders his human will leaves sorrows behind, and holds the glory of the Atman by the grace of the Creator" (Upanishad 59).

"The Atman is beyond sound and form, without touch and taste and perfume. It is eternal, unchangeable, and without beginning or end: indeed above reasoning. When consciousness of the Atman manifests itself, man becomes free from the jaws of death" (Upanishad 61).

"The foolish run after outward pleasures and fall into the snares of vast-embracing death. But the wise have found immortality, and do not seek the Eternal in things that pass away" (Upanishad 62).

"The soul may go to the womb of a mother and thus obtain a new body. It even may go into trees or plants, according to its previous wisdom and work" (Upanishad 64).

"There is one Ruler, the Spirit that is in all things, who transforms his own form into many. Only the wise who see him in their souls attain the joy eternal" (Upanishad 64).

!!!
"If one sees him in this life before the body passes away, one is free from bondage; but if not, one is born and dies again in new worlds and new creations" (Upanishad 65).

!!!
"His form is not in the field of vision: no one sees him with mortal eyes. He is seen by a pure heart and by a mind and thoughts that are pure. Those who know him attain life immortal" (Upanishad 65).

"Words and thoughts cannot reach him and he cannot be seen by the eye" (Upanishad 66).

"When all desires that cling to the heart are surrendered, then a mortal becomes immortal, and even in this world he is one with Brahman" (Upanishad 66).
