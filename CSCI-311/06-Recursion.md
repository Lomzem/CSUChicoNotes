# What is Recursion

Function desc written in 2 parts:
1) base case
2) recursive step

# Divide and Conquer
- Break problem down
- Solve smaller problems
- Combine results

$T(n) = $ time it takes to complete a call

# Ways to Prove Recursion Relations
1) Expansion (iterative method)
2) Substitution
    - Prove guess first
3) Recursion trees

# Substitution
1) Make a guess
2) Prove back guess for recursive case
3) Prove for base case
4) Conclusion
