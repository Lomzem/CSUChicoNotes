# What is Recursion

Function desc written in 2 parts:
1) base case
2) recursive step

# Divide and Conquer
- Break problem down
- Solve smaller problems
- Combine results

$T(n) = $ time it takes to complete a call

# Ways to Prove Recursion Relations
1) Expansion (iterative method)
2) Substitution
    - Prove guess first
3) Recursion trees

# Substitution
1) Make a guess
2) Prove back guess for recursive case
3) Prove for base case
4) Conclusion

# Recursion Trees
1) Draw tree representing how prob splits into subprobs
2) Note time req for each subprob
3) Add up time req for all subprob
4) Recursino tree is not a proof
