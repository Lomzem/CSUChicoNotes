## What is an algorithm?
A sequence of instructions/operations defining how to map inputs to outputs

## What are data structures?
A specific way to organize data

## Algorithm Performance
Two types: **temporal**, **spatial** performance

### Temporal Performance
How quickly job gets done

## Pseudocode
- High level algorithm description that facilitates analysis and is easily translated into a program
- Clear and concise
- Precise and unambiguous
- Programming language agnostic
