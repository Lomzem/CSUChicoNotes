Bandwidth and throughput could usually mean the same thing

# Metrics Examples
- Throughput, Goodput
- Time to first byte
- Latency
- Data Loss
- Round Trip Time
- Repetitiveness
- Hops
- Memory Consumption
- Packet Size
- Concurrent Requests
- Time between packets
- Downtime
- Num Sockets
- Scalability
- Overhead
    - Computational
    - State, memory
    - Communication, disk space
- Security
- Cost

# Main Metrics
- Throughput (bit/s)
- Goodput
- Latency (msec)
    - Round Trip Time
    - Jitter, time between packets
