# ARP
Address Resolution Protocol

How do u find a Layer 2 addr given a Layer 3 addr?
L3 -> L2 Address Mapping

1) Send ARP Request
- **must** be broadcast
- asks local network through Layer 2

2) ARP Response
- correct device responds back w/MAC addr

3) ARP Cache
- Save ARP response for an amount of time, if unused, throw out
- Every end device (maybe except embedded dev) has an ARP cache

# ARP Cache Poisoning
- Send ARP response when you shouldn't have
- Current implementations don't deal with it
