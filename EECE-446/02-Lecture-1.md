Network/Internet is a **shared resource**
- Typically networks aren't computers

Difficult to have one device handle **all** internet traffic
- Physical issues
- Reliability issues

Better to have **collections** of devices

# How to "Find Friend?"
Routing & Forwarding
- RIP, IP, OSPF, BGP
- IP Address
- DNS
- STP, also for [[02-Lecture-1#Limits/Scope|Limits/Scope]]

# Missing Data

## Service Models
- Reliability, different parts of networks provide different levels of reliability
- Security
- TCP Protocol

# End Devices + Network Devices
- Distinction: what is in the network vs what connects to the network

## End Devices
- Examples: Computers, phones, servers, etc.

## Network Devices
- Examples: routers, switches

# Protocols + Standards
- How the shape of data is sent
- IEEE + IETF
- HTTP, SMTP

# Layers
- Divides parts of the network to separate/accomplish specific tasks

# Limits/Scope
- STP, also [[02-Lecture-1#How to "Find Friend?"|Routing]]

# Lookup / Query
- Protocols: ARP, DNS

# IP Address (IPv4)
Example: 192.168.1.5

# MAC/Ethernet Address
Ethernet Example (hex): a3:43:00:ab:37:12
- MAC address is tied to the interface
- Machines could have multiple MAC addresses

# Network Interface (NIC)

# Hostname
Example: www.csuchico.edu

# Unit Prefixes
k = $$10^3$$
