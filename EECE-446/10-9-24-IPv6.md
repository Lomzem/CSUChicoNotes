# IPv6

Why?
- More addresses
    - 128 bits
- Header simplification
- Stateless Autoconfig
    - Could figure out IP addr, gateway, without DHCP server
- What ARP does is part of IPv6
- Mobility & Security integrated

## Why Haven't We Switched?
- Backwards compatibility
- Costs
- Flag day not possible
    - Coordinated switch from IPv4 to IPv6

## Delaying Technologies
- [[10-2-24-ip-addresses#Network Address Translation (NAT|NAT (biggest)]]
- [[10-2-24-ip-addresses#Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR|CIDR]]
- [[10-9-24-DHCP#Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP|DHCP]]

# IPv6 Addresses
- 128 bits
- Always uses slash notation for mask `/24`
- Groups of 16 bits in segments
- Segments separated by colons
- Represented in hex

Example: `fe80:0000:0000:0000:3c72:1000:0000:0030`

## Simplifications
1) Drop leading 0s in any segment
2) Replace any **single** run of 0 segments with `::`
    - At most one per address

After: `fe80::3c72:1000:0:30`

## Reserved Addresses
`::` All 0s - Unknown
`::1` - localhost, loopbaack
`fe80::/12` - Link local addresses, can find addr without DHCP server
